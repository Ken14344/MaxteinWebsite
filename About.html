			<h2>About Our Project</h2>
			<b><p>Probability studies event likelihood, is essential in many fields, and is taught in grade 10. A website with probability exercises can help students review the basics, such as sample spaces, events, and laws of probability. The site can include challenges related to single and multiple events, conditional probabilities, and expected values. It can also offer immediate feedback to help students identify areas that need more practice. A website with probability exercises for 10th graders can be a useful tool to teach the fundamentals and promote academic success. </p></b>
