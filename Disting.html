	<form id="quiz-form">
		<p>1. If a family has two children, and one is a boy, what is the probability that both children are boys?</p>
		<input type="text" id="q1" name="q1" required><br><br>
		
		<p>2. In a certain city, it is known that 20% of the people have blue eyes. If a person is selected at random from the city, what is the probability that the person has blue eyes, given that they are male?</p>
		<input type="text" id="q2" name="q2" required><br><br>
		
		<p>3. A box contains 5 red balls and 3 green balls. If 2 balls are drawn from the box at random, what is the probability that both balls are green, given that the first ball drawn was red?</p>
		<input type="text" id="q3" name="q3" required><br><br>
		
		<p>4. In a factory, 10% of the products are defective. If a batch of 5 products is selected at random, what is the probability that at most 2 of them are defective, given that the first product is defective?</p>
