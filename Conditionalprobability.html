  <h2>Conditional Probability </h2>
	<form id="quiz-form">
		<p>1. A bag contains 10 red marbles and 8 blue marbles. If two marbles are drawn at random without replacement, what is the probability that both marbles are red given that the first marble drawn was red?</p>
		<input type="text" id="q1" name="q1" required><br><br>
		
		<p>2. A multiple-choice test has 20 questions, each with four choices. If a student guesses on each question, what is the probability that the student answers at least 15 questions correctly given that the student answered the first 10 questions correctly?</p>
		<input type="text" id="q2" name="q2" required><br><br>
		
		<p>3. A basketball player makes 80% of their free throws. If the player is given 10 free throws, what is the probability that they make exactly 7 of them given that they made the first 4 free throws?</p>
		<input type="text" id="q3" name="q3" required><br><br>
		
		<p>4. A company produces two types of products, A and B. Product A has a 30% defective rate, while product B has a 20% defective rate. If a product is chosen at random and is found to be defective, what is the probability that it is product A?</p>
